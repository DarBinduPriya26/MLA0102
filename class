Algorithm DECISION_TREE_CONSTRUCTION(Dataset)

1.Compute Entropy of Dataset using ENTROPY(Dataset)
2.Select attribute a1 as the root node
3.Split Dataset based on values of a1
4.If a1 = False:
       1.All instances belong to class Yes
       2.Create a leaf node with label Yes

5.If a1 = True:
      1.Select attribute a3 for further splitting

6.Split data where a1 = True based on values of a3
7.If a3 = High:
      1.All instances belong to class No
      2.Create a leaf node with label No

8.If a3 = Normal:
      1.All instances belong to class Yes
      2.Return the constructed Decision Tree

9.Create a leaf node with label Yes
